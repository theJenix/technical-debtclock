# technical-debtclock

Why is this useful?

When building software fast, it’s easy to throw some code together with a TODO to “do it right next time”.  That’s technical debt, and it’s ok…but it’s also nice to have a reminder of how in the hole you are at a given time.

Is this a joke?

Yes.  Yes it is.  But nowhere does it say that jokes can’t be useful.

Is it working?

Not yet.  Development has just started.
